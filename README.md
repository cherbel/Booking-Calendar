# Booking-Calendar

A simple class that keeps track of bookings. Would work for something like keeping track of a single room in a hotel for a year.

I am slowly trying to build on it and make it better. Possible making it work for more than a year, anything to make it more usable.

Straight C++. Just something for you to look at, use, and make better if you want. I am open to any ideas.
