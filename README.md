# Booking-Calendar

A simple class that keeps track of bookings. It would work best for keeping track of a single room in a hotel.

I am slowly trying to build on it and make it better. Possibly making it work for more than a year, anything to make it more usable.

Straight C++. Just something for you to look at, use, and make better.
