# Booking-Calendar

A simple class in C++ that keeps track of bookings. The class provides a basic framework keeping track of the days for which something is booked.

I am slowly trying to build on it and make it better. I would like to make it work for an indefinite amount of time. If you have an idea for something that I could do better or want to make something better yourself, let me know or submit a pull request.
